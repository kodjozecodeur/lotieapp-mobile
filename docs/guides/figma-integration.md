# 🎨 Figma to Flutter Integration Guide

This guide will help you seamlessly integrate your custom Figma designs into your Flutter app using the clean architecture we've set up.

## 📋 Prerequisites

1. **Figma Account** with your design files
2. **Figma to Flutter Plugin** (recommended: "Figma to Flutter" by Adobe)
3. **Figma Tokens Plugin** (for design tokens)
4. **Figma to Code Plugin** (alternative option)

## 🚀 Step-by-Step Integration Process

### 1. Export Assets from Figma

#### A. Icons & Images
```
1. Select your icon/image in Figma
2. Right-click → Export
3. Choose format:
   - SVG for icons (scalable, small size)
   - PNG for images (1x, 2x, 3x for different densities)
4. Export to: assets/icons/ or assets/images/
```

#### B. Lottie Animations
```
1. Install "Lottie" plugin in Figma
2. Select your animation frame
3. Export as Lottie JSON
4. Save to: assets/animations/
```

#### C. Custom Fonts
```
1. Download font files from Figma
2. Add to: assets/fonts/
3. Update pubspec.yaml fonts section
```

### 2. Design Tokens Setup

Create a design tokens system for consistent theming:

#### A. Colors
- Export color palette from Figma
- Update `lib/core/constants/design_tokens.dart`
- Use Figma color values exactly

#### B. Typography
- Export text styles from Figma
- Update `lib/core/constants/design_tokens.dart`
- Configure font families and sizes

#### C. Spacing & Sizing
- Export spacing system from Figma
- Update `lib/core/constants/design_tokens.dart`
- Use consistent spacing values

### 3. Component Integration

#### A. Create Component Library
```
lib/core/widgets/figma_components/
├── figma_button.dart
├── figma_card.dart
├── figma_input.dart
├── figma_modal.dart
└── figma_navigation.dart
```

#### B. Implement Design System
- Match Figma component specifications exactly
- Use design tokens for consistency
- Implement responsive behavior

### 4. Screen Implementation

#### A. Layout Structure
1. Analyze Figma screen layout
2. Break down into reusable components
3. Implement using Flutter widgets
4. Match spacing and alignment exactly

#### B. Responsive Design
- Use `flutter_screenutil` for responsive sizing
- Implement breakpoints for different screen sizes
- Test on various device sizes

## 🛠️ Recommended Tools & Plugins

### Figma Plugins
1. **Figma to Flutter** - Direct code generation
2. **Figma Tokens** - Design tokens export
3. **Figma to Code** - Alternative code generation
4. **Lottie** - Animation export
5. **Figma to SVG** - SVG export optimization

### Flutter Packages (Already Added)
- `flutter_svg` - SVG support
- `flutter_screenutil` - Responsive design
- `lottie` - Animation support
- `google_fonts` - Font integration
- `shimmer` - Loading effects
- `flutter_animate` - Advanced animations

## 📁 File Organization

```
assets/
├── images/
│   ├── backgrounds/
│   ├── illustrations/
│   └── photos/
├── icons/
│   ├── navigation/
│   ├── actions/
│   └── status/
├── animations/
│   ├── loading/
│   ├── success/
│   └── transitions/
└── fonts/
    ├── custom-font-regular.ttf
    ├── custom-font-bold.ttf
    └── custom-font-light.ttf
```

## 🎯 Best Practices

### 1. Naming Conventions
- Use descriptive names: `ic_home_filled.svg`
- Follow snake_case for files
- Group by category in folders

### 2. Asset Optimization
- Compress images before adding
- Use SVG for simple icons
- Optimize Lottie animations

### 3. Code Organization
- Create reusable components
- Use design tokens consistently
- Follow clean architecture principles

### 4. Testing
- Test on multiple screen sizes
- Verify design accuracy
- Check performance impact

## 🔄 Workflow

1. **Design in Figma** → Export assets
2. **Add to Flutter** → Update assets folder
3. **Create Components** → Implement in Flutter
4. **Test & Refine** → Ensure pixel-perfect match
5. **Document** → Update component library

## 📱 Responsive Considerations

- Use `flutter_screenutil` for responsive sizing
- Implement breakpoints for tablet/desktop
- Test on various device sizes
- Consider accessibility requirements

## 🎨 Design System Integration

- Maintain consistency with Figma design system
- Use design tokens for all values
- Implement proper theming support
- Support light/dark mode if applicable

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. Install the recommended Figma plugins
2. Export your first set of assets
3. Update the design tokens
4. Create your first Figma component
5. Implement your first screen
